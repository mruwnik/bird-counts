# Bird counter

A simple web app that simulates birds singing to each other, with the option of reacting to a different birds singing. Counts can be downloaded - reload the page to restart the simulation.

There is also the possibility of simulating observers (i.e. researchers trying to count birds) which can move around (or not) on the basis of various counting methods. Observers can also be dragged around to manually position them.

## Demo

## Getting started

Shadow-cljs is used for compiling, so make sure it's [available](https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#_command_line). If so, then `shadow-cljs server` should be enough to get things running.
I personally use Emacs + Cider for development, but a quick test of the above allowed me to run things locally.
